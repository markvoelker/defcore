    Tabulate capability scores and write them to files.

    This utility script tabulates scores from a DefCore scoring
    worksheet based on the weights from a given Guideline JSON file.
    It writes the scores in three formats:

    1.)  A text file that is identical to the source scoring
         worksheet, but with an added column for the total score
         for each capability.
    2.)  A CSV file with each capability's individual Criteria scores
         as well as the total.  The first line of the file will be
         the plain-English Criteria names as parsed from the Guideline
         json file.
    3.)  A simple "capability-name: total-score" output to stdout.
         This is primarily useful for getting quick feedback on
         the effect of changing scores.
