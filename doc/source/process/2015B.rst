Process Definition
--------------------------------------

The DefCore Guideline process has two primary phases: Draft and Review.
During the Draft phase (A), the DefCore Committee is working with community
leaders to update and score the components of the guideline.  During the
Review phase (B), general community and vendors have an opportunity to
provide input and check the guidelines (C) against actual implementations.
Review phase ends with Board approval of the draft guideline (D).

This section provides specific rules and structure for each phase.

NOTE: To ensure continuity of discussion, process components defined below
must _not_ reuse numbers in future revisions.  The numbering pattern
follows draft, section and sub-item numbering, e.g.: 2015A.B2.2.  This
requirement may create numbering gaps in future iterations that will help
indicate changes.

Guidelines Draft Phase (A)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Starting: S-3

A1. New Guidelines Start From Previous Guidelines

  1. New Guidelines start from the previous Board approved document.
  2. New Guidelines are given the preliminary name of the target year and
     .next.  (ref section D4)

A2. Community Groups Tests into Capabilities

  1. DefCore Committee coordinates community activities with the Technical
     Leadership to revise the capabilities based on current technical needs
     and functionality.
  2. Capabilities must correspond to projects which are part of the
     "TC-approved release" as designated by the TC (see bylaws of the
     Foundation, section 4.1(b)(iii)).
  3. Groupings may change between iterations.
  4. Tests must have unique identifiers that are durable across releases
     and changes in grouping.
  5. Tests must be under OpenStack Technical Committee governance.
  6. The DefCore committee will provide the test groupings in JSON format
     for scoring.
  7. The DefCore committee will provide a human-readable summary of
     the Guideline generated from the JSON version.

A3. DefCore Collects Recommendations for Designated Sections

  1. Designated Sections will not be removed without being deprecated in the
     previous Guideline.
  2. Designated Sections will not be added without being advisory in the
     previous Guideline.
  3. Designated Sections will not be added or be made advisory unless the
     corresponding code base is designated as part of the "TC-approved release"
     by the Technical Committee (see bylaws of the Foundation, section
     4.1(b)(iii)).
  4. Technical leadership may, but is not required to, assist DefCore with
     defining advisory sections for projects that have advisory or required
     capabilities.

A4. DefCore Committee identifies required capabilities

  1. DefCore uses Board approved DefCore scoring criteria to evaluate
     capabilities.
  2. DefCore needs Board approval to change scoring
     criteria.
  3. Scoring criteria factor or weights cannot change after Draft is
     published.
  4. DefCore identifies cut-off score for determining that a
     capability is required.

  1. Board committee members of DefCore serve as "core" reviewers (+2).
  2. Requests for changes must be submitted as patches by the requesting
     party.
  3. DefCore Committee members may proxy change requests as long as the
     requesting party is explicitly acknowledged.

B5. Technical Committee and User Committee Representation

  1. The Technical Committee will be represented on the DefCore Committee
     by two liaisons appointed by the Technical Committee.  One or both
     liaisons must be members of the Technical Committee.
  2. The User Committee will be represented on the DefCore Committee
     by two liaisons appointed by the User Committee.  One or both
     liaisons must be members of the User Committee.
  3. The DefCore Committee shall appoint two liaisons to the Technical
     Committee.  These liaisons will be charged with regular attendance
     at Technical Committee meetings and will serve as a point of contact
     to foster communication with the Technical Committee.
  4. The DefCore Committee shall appoint two liaisons to the User
     Committee.  These liaisons will be charged with regular attendance
     at User Committee meetings and will serve as a point of contact

     approximately the top five technical challenges it faces in producing
     strong Guidelines to be delivered to the Technical and User Committees
     at the Design Summit.  The report is intended to advise the TC of areas
     where technical governance assistance is requested to help resolve
     interoperability challenges between or among projects, and to advise
     the User Committee of interoperability challenges that users may face.

Community Review & Vendor Self-Test (C)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
