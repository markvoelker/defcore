Governance Process
==================

* Meetings will be open to all community members.  Information about how
  and when to join meetings will be posted on the
  defcore-committee@lists.openstack.org mailing list and/or the
  `DefCore Committee wiki page 
  <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Governance/DefCoreCommittee>`_.  

* Members are expected to to their homework. We will not be rehashing
  due to time limits.  Minutes from prior meetings will be posted to the
  `DefCore Committee wiki page
  <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Governance/DefCoreCommittee>`_.

* Process documents and other "rules of the road" will be maintained and
  voted on in `Gerrit 
  <http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/defcore>`_.  Committee
  chairs will have +/-2 voting privilleges.
